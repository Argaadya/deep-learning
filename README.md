# Deep Learning

Some of my deep learning projects are scattered, but the following project is where I learn and write something that interest me about deep learning:

- Image Classification: Detecting Cat, Dog, or Panda
- Image Classification: Detectiong 10 Different Species of Monkey with Transfer Learning
- Text Classification: Steam Game Reviews
- Text Classification: Detecting Indonesian Hate Speech

Some of these projects are done using R while others are using python. However, currently all of them are using keras dan tensorflow to build the model.
